# TO-DO-List
🚀 Built a Simple To-Do List Web App! ✅

I recently developed a To-Do List website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance my frontend skills. This project allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, making task management easier and more organized.

🔹 Key Features:
✔️ User-friendly interface
✔️ Dynamic task management with JavaScript
✔️ Local storage to retain tasks even after page refresh

This was a great learning experience, and I look forward to adding more features! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. 😊
